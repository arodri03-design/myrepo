Week 12

This week I used AI to make the testing and refactoring topics easier to understand. The lecture had a lot of parts, so I asked AI to explain things in simple terms. It helped me see the difference between unit tests, integration tests, and system tests without getting overwhelmed. It also explained refactoring in a way that finally made sense to me, as basically cleaning up code without changing what it does.

Using AI made it easier for me to connect everything to Project 4. It helped me figure out what I actually need to test and why each type of test matters. Overall it made the whole topic feel more manageable and gave me a clearer idea of how to approach my work.
