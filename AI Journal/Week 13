Week 13



This week, I used AI mainly as a support tool while working on my INST326 capstone project, especially for understanding system integration, persistence, and testing. AI helped me break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable steps, which made the project feel less overwhelming.

One of the most helpful parts was using AI to clarify how different components of our system fit together, particularly how the DataManager interacts with participant data and testing. Instead of giving me answers to copy, AI acted more like a guide that explained why certain design choices made sense and how they connected to real software development practices.

I also used AI to help rephrase explanations in simpler terms, which made it easier for me to understand the purpose behind features like saving and loading data or writing unit and integration tests. This helped me feel more confident explaining my work to others and preparing for the final presentation.

Overall, AI this week felt less like a shortcut and more like a learning companion that helped me slow down, understand the bigger picture, and stay calm while working through a challenging project.
