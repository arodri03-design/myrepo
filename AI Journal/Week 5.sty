This week, I used AI to help me complete the encapsulation exercises for the Library Management Project. I asked AI to show me examples of how to use private and protected attributes, getters, setters, and the @property decorator with validation. The AI explained how to keep attributes private, how to write validation checks inside setters, and how to organize each class clearly. I also used it to confirm that my code stayed within the Week 5 scope (no inheritance or class methods). I reviewed each function and modified some names and logic myself to make sure I understood what was happening.


I used AI to help me write clean, professional, and PEP 8â€“compliant code for my three functions: extract_keywords, parse_csv_data, and validate_url_format. AI guided me in structuring my functions with proper docstrings, type hints, and input validation. It also helped me understand how to handle errors effectively and improve readability. I used AI mainly for clarification and refinement
