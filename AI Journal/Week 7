week 7 

This week I used AI while working on the error handling and testing exercises for the library management project. I used it to explain certain Python concepts and to look at examples for things like f-strings, exception handling, and unit testing. It helped me better understand how to raise and catch custom exceptions, and how to structure test cases using unittest. I didn’t use AI to complete any of the exercises or for debugging.

My project team also used AI to organize our ideas and translate them into project requirements that we then used to draft our project charter. Using AI for that process made it easier to turn our discussions into something structured and ready to present. Overall, I learned that AI can be a great tool for clarifying technical concepts and for helping a team move from brainstorming to a clear plan.
