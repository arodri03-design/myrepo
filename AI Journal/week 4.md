Section 0303

This week I used AI to help me understand how classes and objects work in Python. It explained what init does and showed me examples of how to make methods. I didnâ€™t use AI to do the exercises or fix my code, just to learn the ideas better. My group also used AI to help plan how our project classes would work together.
