This week I used AI while working on the Week 6 Python exercises about methods and class design. I mainly used it to review how instance, class, and static methods work in Python and to see examples of how to apply them in the Library Management project. AI helped me understand when to use each type of method and how to structure my code more clearly, especially for things like classmethod and staticmethod.

I did not use AI to directly complete or debug the exercises. Instead, I used it for clarification and short code examples to confirm I was using the correct logic. 

This week, I also tested Gemini again for basic Python explanations but found it less helpful because the examples were incomplete and not very readable. ChatGPTâ€™s responses were much clearer and better structured for this kind of coding assignment.
